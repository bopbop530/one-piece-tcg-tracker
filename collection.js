     keeps the original so a migration can be audited or undone.

     A graded card carries `grader` + `grade`; `cond` applies to raw copies

     because optcgapi had no unique id. v2 keys on TCGplayer's productId, which
     is a real primary key. Every saved row — local and in the sheet — has to
     be repointed, and rows are the only thing in this app that cannot be
     re-fetched, so the rule is: never guess, and never drop.

     Matching is on card NAME plus card NUMBER, both of which survived the
     source change intact. The image id carries a random suffix on variants
     ("OP04-056_p2", "OP16-011_l76oKss"); the part before the first underscore
     is the card number, which is what TCGplayer calls extNumber.

     Anything that does not match exactly one card is left untouched and
     reported, so it shows up in the UI for you to fix by hand rather than
     silently becoming a $0 row or disappearing.
